## Overview

The project is a very basic single-page e-commerce website with the following features

- Optimal layout for the site depending on a device's screen size
- State change for interactive elements on hover
- Lightbox gallery that's displayed when the large product image on screen is clicked
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it


This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.10. 
The project was also styled using [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
